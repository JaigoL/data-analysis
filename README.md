# data-analysis

Welcome to my data analysis portfolio repository.

This repository contains a collection of data analysis projects where I apply different techniques to explore, clean, analyze, and visualize data.

I am an aspiring Data Analyst with a strong interest in transforming data into actionable insights. I enjoy working with data, identifying patterns, and communicating results in a clear and meaningful way.

Feel free to explore the projects or reach out if you’d like to connect.
